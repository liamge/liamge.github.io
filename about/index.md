My research focuses on primarily the fields of Computational Semantics, Natural Language Understanding, and Deep Learning and Neural Networks for NLP. My thesis focuses on training a syntactically motivated semantic composition function via the use of [Recursive Neural Networks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.383.1327&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to allow for a length agnostic semantic vector-space rather than the word level vector-space of other algorithms. To read more about this research, you can download my thesis [here](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2875/). The acompanying code for this thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/liamge/Pytorch_ReNN).

I have experience in the professional sphere creating novel NLP algorithms and production-ready code for a downstream application, as well as building chatbots using existing frameworks such as wit.ai.

In my free time I like to make dumb games and (hopefully) not dumb music. Games were mostly made in weekend long game jams, check them out [here](https://itch.io/profile/nunfuel).
