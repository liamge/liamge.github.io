My research focuses on primarily the fields of Computational Semantics, Natural Language Understanding, and Deep Learning and Neural Networks for NLP. My thesis focuses on training a syntactically motivated semantic composition function via the use of [Recursive Neural Networks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.383.1327&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to allow for a length agnostic semantic vector-space rather than the word level vector-space of other algorithms. To read more about this research, you can download my proposal [here](https://github.com/liamge/liamge.github.io/raw/master/assets/thesis_overview.pdf). The thesis is expected to be done in May 2018 and will be posted on here along with the code for the project.

In my free time I like to explore smaller NLP projects that I'll also post on this website. Recently, I have done an analysis of the difference between Conservative and Liberal posts on Reddit, analyzed what makes a good Bachelorette contestant, and built a self-driving RC. All these projects will be posted on this website once I finish writing the actual blog posts.
